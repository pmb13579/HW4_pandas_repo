    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2002 to 2005 I served as the Director of Research and Evaluation for the Berkeley Unified School District.  Essentially, I was their Chief Data Scientist.  In that role, I built a student achievement database including standardized test score data, as well as course grades, AP test scores, various district assessments, etc.  I provided presentations, reports and analyses for the school board, district administrators, school principals, teachers, and outside researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis of results**\n",
    "\n",
    "The district has 15 high schools serving about 40,000 stents.  Average math scores are about 79 and average reading scores are about 82.  About 75% pass math, 86% pass reading, and 89% pass overall.  This probably results from most students being strong in at least one of these two subject areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 performing schools have an overall passing rates of above 99%, while the bottom 5 performing schools have an overall passing rate of about 85%.  On average, the more a school spends per student, the lower their overall passing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller schools with less than 2,000 students have an average overall passing rate of above 99%, while schools with over 2,000 students have an average overall passing rate of about 86%.  Finally, charter schools have an overall passing rate of above 99%, as compared to district schools with an overall passing rate of about 85%\n",
    "\n",
    "These differences may be a result of better curriculum and teaching.  However, in my experience, they are often primarily caused by significant differences in the student populations being served.  Specifically, students may differ in their abilities and motivation when they first arrive at the various schools.  These differences are often correlated with socioeconomic factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, more analysis must be done before firm conclusions can be reached.  Such analysis could look at student growth from year to year, although this may be difficult if there is significant student turnover.  Also, it is worth considering whether there are sufficient incentives to cause students to try to do their best on the tests.\n",
